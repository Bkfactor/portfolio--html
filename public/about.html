    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, I’m a tech enthusiast who loves turning ideas into real, working
      projects. Whether it’s coding a new app, analyzing data to find hidden
      patterns, or experimenting with cool web designs, I enjoy exploring how
      technology can solve everyday problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m also big on community and collaboration. Over time, I’ve worked on
      challenges, events, and small projects that bring people together to
      learn, create, and share. For me, tech is more than just code—it’s about
      building connections and making an impact.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I’m not deep into Python, web development, or machine learning,
      you’ll probably find me learning something new, brainstorming the next
      project, or finding creative ways to push my skills further. The goal is
      simple: keep growing, keep building, and keep having fun along the way.
